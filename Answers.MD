What is the purpose of the various auxiliary methods populateList, populateFifoList, and ReverseLines.printReverse?

    To add items and print them using a recursion statement instead of a bunch of looping.


Why do these methods need to have arguments, and how does the argument change from one recursive call to the next?

    Arguments are used by the recursion statement to call itself again. The arguments are each piece of a dataset or node.


What are the time and space complexity of each of the populateList populateFifoList methods, as well as ReverseLines.printReverse?

    All of them are O(N)


Which of these methods can be implemented using while loops?

    I'm fairly certain everything in the world can be done with complicated enough while loops.
    All of these recursion statements can for sure.
